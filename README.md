# Generalized-Bernoulli-Numbers-Code
The following sections of code were used to assist in research examining standard bernoulli numbers and generalized bernoulli numbers. The aim was to not just generate such numbers, but to find trends between them, particularly in regards to correlation.

The language used is primarily python adapted for Sage Math. Numpy and Scipy are used extensively throughout. All code can be run via Sage Math Cell (https://sagecell.sagemath.org/)
